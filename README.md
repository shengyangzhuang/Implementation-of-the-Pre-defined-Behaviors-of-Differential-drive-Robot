# Implementation-of-the-Pre-defined-Behaviors-of-Differential-drive-Robot
The goal of this project is to control a differential-drive robot to make it follow a pre-defined behavior in the workspace. Firstly, we analysed a simple mathematical model of the robot kinematics. Then, we abstracted the motion of the robot as a finite Transition System T and derived a high-level plan that satisfied a given specification. In order to enable the robot to follow the trajectory that we havd planned, we designed and implemented a hybrid controller, consisting of two parts (rotation controller and go-to-line controller). One was to rotate the robot to a certain orientation and the other to navigate the robot along a straight line. A real world application of this controller could be, for example, a robot that brings medicine to patients in a hospital. The robot cannot drive around like it wants to but has to follow the corridor network of the hospital. Therefore, the robot first rotates until it faces to the point in the corridor it wants to reach and then follows a straight line to this point. If this point is, for example, the room of a patient, the robot stops. Otherwise it starts the procedure again to go to another point in the corridor environment until it reaches its actual goal.
